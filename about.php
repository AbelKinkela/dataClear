        <h3>Data clear</h3>
        <p>
            This platform targets students conducting market research for project
            coursework at the university. Such students include those starting university</p><br>
<p>These students work on slide presentations and lack skills to analyse large amounts of data. Nonetheless, they know how to read different types of graphs
    such as bar charts, pie charts, histograms, and line charts. For the research they
    conduct, they look for numbers and visualizations.</p><br>
    <p> They do not have much time to spend on a website due to the fact
        that their deadlines are tight. That is why the website must be
        clear and concise, not too much text when providing an explanation
        or giving context and with visualizations that are clear.</p>
